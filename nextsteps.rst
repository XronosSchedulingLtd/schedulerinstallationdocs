Next steps
==========

At this point you have all the Scheduler software installed and running,
but:

- It's running in development mode, from the command line.
- It's running with demonstration data.

Obviously you want it running in production mode using a proper web
server, and you want it to have data specific to your school, rather
than made up stuff.

These two issues can be dealt with in either order - production mode
first or data first.  It's up to you.

- Setting up real data
- Configuring :ref:`production_mode`
