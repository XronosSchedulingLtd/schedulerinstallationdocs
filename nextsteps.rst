Next steps
==========

At this point you have all the Scheduler software installed and running,
but:

- It's running in development mode, from the command line.
- It's running with demonstration data.

Obviously you want it running in production mode using a proper web
server, and you want it to have data specific to your school, rather
than made up stuff.

It is necessary to perform the next three steps in order because of
the constraints of authentication.

* You need a working web server before you can set up https.
* You need https before you can enable authentication.
