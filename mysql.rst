MySQL
=====

Currently the application uses MySQL as its database server, so install MySQL.

::

  $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev

During the installation, you will be prompted for a password for the
MySQL root user.  Make this something different from both your user's
password and the system root password.  Save it carefully, because you
will need it later.
