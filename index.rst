Xronos Scheduler - installation instructions.

Xronos Scheduler is a web application, written using the
`Ruby on Rails <http://rubyonrails.org>`_ web application framework.
As such, it can be deployed to any of the many hosting services which
provide support for such applications.

These instructions are intended for those who want instead to set up
a suitable hosting platform for themselves - either a dedicated
physical machine, or some kind of virtual server.

In these circumstances, the recommended operating system is
`Debian GNU/Linux <https://www.debian.org>`_, version 8 - Jessie.
It should be relatively straightforward to use any other version
of Linux, or MacOS.

You may already have your own web application infrastructure, in which
case you should be able to slot Scheduler into it.

These instructions assume you are using a fresh, blank installation
of Debian GNU/Linux version 8, with just the bare operating system installed.
